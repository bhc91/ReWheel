## 01: Using Flask with SQLAlchemy for Database Management

### Meta

Status
: **Decided**

Updated
: 11-Nov-2024

### Problem statement

We need a way to handle database operations for our automotive parts application, **PartWatch**. The application includes user registration, roles, parts listings and purchases. We need to decide on an efficient way to interact with our SQLite database that will also support future scalability when we move to a more robust database.

### Decision

We decided to use **SQLAlchemy** as our Object Relational Mapper (ORM) to manage database interactions. This decision was made because of SQLAlchemy's compatibility with Flask, its support for an ORM layer, and its flexibility to work with multiple database engines in the future. The decision was made by the development team.

### Regarded options

1. **Plain SQL** - Direct SQL queries embedded in the code.
2. **SQLAlchemy ORM** - Use SQLAlchemy ORM for a more Pythonic database interaction.

| Criterion              | Plain SQL                       | SQLAlchemy ORM                      |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Ease of Use**        | Requires raw SQL for each query | Provides a high-level API for CRUD  |
| **Future Scalability** | Limited                         | Easily switchable to other DBs      |
| **Readability**        | Complex with inline SQL         | More readable with Python classes   |
| **Learning Curve**     | None if SQL is known           | Moderate, but well-documented       |

## 02: User Roles and Permissions (Customer vs. Supplier)

### Meta

Status
: **Decided**

Updated
: 11-Nov-2024

### Problem statement

The application requires different user roles: **Suppliers**, who can list parts, and **Customers**, who can browse and order parts. We need a system to enforce these permissions based on the userâ€™s role.

### Decision

We implemented a **role-based access control** system by adding a `role` column to the `User` model in the database. This allows us to differentiate permissions in the app, such as allowing only suppliers to add new parts. 

The decision was made to simplify role management without creating overly complex permissions and is in line with our initial project requirements.

### Regarded options

1. **Role-based access control (simpler)** - Add a `role` attribute to users to control permissions.
2. **Advanced Permissions System (complex)** - Implement a detailed permissions matrix for each action.

| Criterion             | Simple Role System         | Advanced Permissions System         |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Implementation**    | Easy to set up             | Requires detailed permission checks |
| **Flexibility**       | Sufficient for two roles   | Better for complex permissions      |
| **Performance**       | Lightweight                | Higher processing for permissions   |

## 03: Image Upload and Storage for Part Listings

### Meta

Status
: **Decided**

Updated
: 11-Nov-2024

### Problem statement

Suppliers need to upload images of automotive parts for their listings. We need a reliable way to handle image uploads and storage within the app.

### Decision

We chose to store images locally in the `static/images` directory. When a user uploads an image, it is saved directly to this folder, and the file path is stored in the database. This approach keeps the app lightweight and avoids the need for third-party storage services during development.

### Regarded options

1. **Local Storage** - Store images in a local directory within the project.
2. **Cloud Storage (e.g., AWS S3)** - Use a cloud service to store and retrieve images.

| Criterion              | Local Storage               | Cloud Storage                   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Setup Complexity**   | Simple                      | More complex                    |
| **Cost**               | Free                        | Potential costs                 |
| **Scalability**        | Limited by server capacity  | Scalable with storage service   |

## 04: Using WTForms and Bootstrap for User Interface

### Meta

Status
: **Decided**

Updated
: 11-Nov-2024

### Problem statement

To create a consistent and user-friendly interface for form submissions, we need a framework for form handling and styling.

### Decision

We chose **WTForms** for form handling and **Bootstrap** for styling to make the forms more accessible and responsive. WTForms integrates well with Flask, and Bootstrap provides a modern, responsive design that enhances user experience. This combination was chosen to save development time while maintaining a professional look and feel.

### Regarded options

1. **WTForms + Bootstrap** - Use WTForms for form processing and Bootstrap for styling.
2. **Custom HTML/CSS** - Create custom forms without a framework.

| Criterion              | WTForms + Bootstrap         | Custom HTML/CSS                |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Ease of Integration**| Seamless with Flask         | Requires more custom code       |
| **Design Consistency** | Uniform with Bootstrap      | Requires detailed CSS work      |
| **Development Speed**  | Faster setup                | More time-intensive             |

## 05: Order Tracking and My Orders Feature

### Meta

Status
: **Decided**

Updated
: 26-Oct-2024

### Problem statement

The application needs to allow customers to place orders for parts and view their orders under a "My Orders" tab. This requires order data to be stored persistently in the SQLite database, linking each order to a user and a specific part.

### Decision

We added a `Purchase` model to the database to store each order. When a customer places an order, the details are saved in the `Purchase` table, which links the order to the user and the specific part they ordered. Customers can view their past orders in the "My Orders" tab.

### Regarded options

1. **Database Table for Purchases** - Store each order as a record in a `Purchase` table within SQLite.
2. **Session-based Order Tracking** - Track orders only within the user session without permanent storage.

| Criterion              | Database Table              | Session-based Tracking          |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Persistence**        | Permanent in SQLite         | Temporary in session            |
| **Scalability**        | Suitable for multiple users | Limited to active session       |
| **User Experience**    | View past orders anytime    | Only viewable in-session        |
