The **ReWheel** data model is composed of three primary tables: `User`, `Part`, and `Purchase`. These tables work together to support the main functionalities of the application, including user management, part listing, and transaction tracking. This section provides an overview of each table and their relationships within the application.

## User Table

The `User` table stores information about the application's users, including their credentials and role (customer or supplier).

| `availability` | String (100)  | Stock status (e.g., `In Stock`, `Out of Stock`). |
| `quantity`     | Integer       | Available quantity of the part.                  |
| `delivery`     | String (100)  | Estimated delivery time for the part.            |
| `image`        | String (200)  | Path to the part image file.                     |

| `model`        | String (100)  | Model of the part.                               |

## Purchase Table

The `Purchase` table logs transactions between customers and suppliers, including buyer details and payment information.

| Column         | Type          | Description                                      |
|----------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `id`           | Integer       | Primary key for each purchase.                   |
| `part_id`      | Integer       | Foreign key linking to the purchased part.       |
| `user_id`      | Integer       | Foreign key linking to the buyer (User).         |
| `name`         | String (150)  | Name of the buyer.                               |

| `total_price`  | Float         | Total cost of the purchase.                      |
| `purchase_date`| DateTime      | Date and time of the transaction.                |

## Relationships

- **User ↔ Part**: One-to-many relationship where each user (supplier) can offer multiple parts.
- **Part ↔ Purchase**: One-to-many relationship where each part can have multiple purchases associated with it.
- **User ↔ Purchase**: One-to-many relationship where each user can make multiple purchases.

## Additional Considerations

- **Security**: Sensitive fields like `card_number` and `cvc` should be encrypted or hashed for secure storage.
- **Data Validation**: Enforce validation on fields like `quantity` and `price` to ensure data integrity.
- **Indexing**: Fields such as `email` in `User` and `id` in all tables can be indexed to improve query performance.

This data model structure allows **ReWheel** to efficiently manage users, automotive parts, and purchase transactions, ensuring data consistency and security throughout the application.
